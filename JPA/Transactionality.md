 CRUD methods on repository instances inherited from SimpleJpaRepository are transactional. For read operations, the transaction configuration readOnly flag is set to true. All others are configured with a plain @Transactional so that default transaction configuration applies. Repository methods that are backed by transactional repository fragments inherit the transactional attributes from the actual fragment method.

Using a facade to define transactions for multiple repository calls
 ```
 @Service
public class UserManagementImpl implements UserManagement {

  private final UserRepository userRepository;
  private final RoleRepository roleRepository;

  public UserManagementImpl(UserRepository userRepository,
    RoleRepository roleRepository) {
    this.userRepository = userRepository;
    this.roleRepository = roleRepository;
  }

  @Transactional
  public void addRoleToAllUsers(String roleName) {

    Role role = roleRepository.findByName(roleName);

    for (User user : userRepository.findAll()) {
      user.addRole(role);
      userRepository.save(user);
    }
  }
}
```
This example causes call to addRoleToAllUsers(â€¦) to run inside a transaction (participating in an existing one or creating a new one if none are already running). The transaction configuration at the repositories is then neglected, as the outer transaction configuration determines the actual one used. Note that you must activate <tx:annotation-driven /> or use @EnableTransactionManagement explicitly to get annotation-based configuration of facades to work. This example assumes you use component scanning.


Using @Transactional at query methods
```
@Transactional(readOnly = true)
interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {

  List<User> findByLastname(String lastname);

  @Modifying
  @Transactional
  @Query("delete from User u where u.active = false")
  void deleteInactiveUsers();
}
```
Typically, you want the readOnly flag to be set to true, as most of the query methods only read data. In contrast to that, deleteInactiveUsers() makes use of the @Modifying annotation and overrides the transaction configuration. Thus, the method runs with the readOnly flag set to false.
