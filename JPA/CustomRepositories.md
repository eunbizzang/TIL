Custom Implementations for Spring Data Repositories


Spring Data provides various options to create query methods with little coding. 
But when those options donâ€™t fit your needs you can also provide your own custom implementation for repository methods. 


Customizing Individual Repositories
To enrich a repository with custom functionality, you must first define a fragment interface and an implementation for the custom functionality, as follows:

Example 29. Interface for custom repository functionality
```
interface CustomizedUserRepository {
  void someCustomMethod(User user);
}
```

Example 30. Implementation of custom repository functionality
```
class CustomizedUserRepositoryImpl implements CustomizedUserRepository {

  public void someCustomMethod(User user) {
    // Your custom implementation
  }
}
```
The implementation itself does not depend on Spring Data and can be a regular Spring bean.Consequently, you can use standard dependency injection behavior to inject references to other beans (such as a JdbcTemplate), take part in aspects, and so on.
Then you can let your repository interface extend the fragment interface, as follows:

Example 31. Changes to your repository interface
```
interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long>, CustomizedUserRepository {

  // Declare query methods here
}
```

Extending the fragment interface with your repository interface combines the CRUD and custom functionality and makes it available to clients.
