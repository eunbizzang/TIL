dedicated class under a package that contains the code for our scheduled jobs:
```
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableScheduling;

@EnableScheduling
public class SchedulerConfig {

}
```
The scheduling will now only be activated when we load the SchedulerConfig class into the application, providing better modularization.

When the @EnableScheduling annotation is processed, Spring scans the application packages to find all the Spring Beans decorated with @Scheduled methods and sets up their execution schedule.


Enabling Scheduling Based on a Property
```
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.condition.ConditionalOnProperty;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableScheduling;

@Configuration
@EnableScheduling
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "scheduler.enabled", matchIfMissing = true)
public class SchedulerConfig {

}
```
