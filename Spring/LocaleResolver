Interface for web-based locale resolution strategies that allows for both locale resolution via the request and locale modification via request and response.
This interface allows for implementations based on request, session, cookies, etc. The default implementation is AcceptHeaderLocaleResolver, simply using the request's locale provided by the respective HTTP header.
