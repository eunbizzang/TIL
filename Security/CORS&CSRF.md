Cross-Origin resource sharing(CORS)
1. CORS is a protocol that enables scripts running on a browser client to interact with resources from a different origin.
2. For example, if a UI app wishes to make an API call running on a different domain, it would be blocked from doing so by default due to CORS. so CORS is not a security issue/attack but the default protection provided by browsers to stop sharing the data/communication between different origins.
3. "other origins" means the URL being accessed differs from the location that the JavaScript is running from, by having : 
- a different scheme(HTTP or HTTPS)
- a different domain
- a different port
